            <p class="project-desc">EduMate is a full-stack educational support platform designed to help students manage learning resources and track academic progress.</p>
            <p class="project-desc">The application uses React, Node.js, and Prisma ORM to manage database schemas and queries safely. Contributed to the project by implementing structured logging for method calls and API requests to improve system monitoring and debugging. Assisted in identifying and resolving bugs to enhance application stability and performance. Worked collaboratively to ensure smoother backend operations and better traceability of system activities. </p>

            <h3>Small claims court booking system(Ongoing)</h3>
            <p class="project-desc">A full-stack backend application designed to manage small claims court appointments efficiently and securely.</p>
            <p class="project-desc">In this project, I set up a Node.js and Express.js server, developing RESTful API routes for user registration and authentication. I integrated PostgreSQL as the database, designing and managing structured tables for clients and appointments to ensure reliable data handling.

                To enhance security, I implemented JWT-based authentication and used bcrypt to hash user passwords, ensuring secure access control. I configured environment variables to protect sensitive information such as database credentials and JWT secrets.

                I tested API endpoints using Thunder Client in VS Code to verify functionality and ensure smooth communication between the server and database. Additionally, I implemented version control using Git, created a proper .gitignore file to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files, and successfully pushed the backend project to GitHub for collaboration and deployment readiness.</p>
